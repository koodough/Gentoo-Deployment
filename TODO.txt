TODO
####

Soon
* Replace htpdate with ntpdate
* Add Compiz
* Add Power Management
* LVM support
* Get the latest stage3
* Guess what architecture the system is
* Create a suggested make.conf file
* Fix Distcc parsing for multiple IP addresses
* Detect to see if the OS architecture can chroot. If it fails instruct to to do it properly 
* Fix Grub and the tab, if that messes up DOOM will happen. Will never boot correctly until its deleted in mtab. Maybe just delete mtab once 
* Add udev to rc-update for the mouse and keyboard to work
* Error Capture - No sys folder no Xorg!!! ok!
* Fix bash complete with a #


Later
* Create modules. Scripts with options to add to the gentoo deployment. AFP, GNOME, KDE, etc.. would be in separate files
* DHCP or Manual option
* Test for internet before starting
* Ask if you plan on compiling your own kernel or using genkernel and emerge if necessary
* Better MD5 sum method to verify
* Support Graphics cards

Version 4
* Work on multiple architectures - x86, amd64, PPC, PPC64 using a skeleton commands for that arch
* Ncurses support
* Rewrite in Python?


For Linuxraptor
* Create the flags for the make.conf that would be equivalent to march=native

####Thoughts
Python
Stack for the function. Have the script run while there still could be errors

Awesome Conky Theme. Tron like. Welcome message

gentoo deployment

--compress_root_tree | --compress | -c

#File 1:Configure
#Ask for which step
#Step 1:Pre chroot
	#Ask for Date
		#NO
			#Fix the date with htpdate, which may be on the live cd
				#NO
					#Manually set it then
	#Ask for root parition
	#Ask for boot parition
	#Ask for chroot directory. Default is /mnt/gentoo

	#Variables
	#ROOT_PARTITION
	#BOOT_PARTITION
	#CHROOT_DIR
	#STAGE3_URL
	#PORTAGE_URL
	#Ask if to use a root tree package
		#Yes. List root tree packages
		#No. Tell them that they need to make their make.conf
	
#Step 2:Pre Install
	#DO necessary stuff, maybe ask for this stuff
	#Ask for localtime. Default is America/Chicago. Setup localtime and the clock
	#Do env-update && source /etc/profile and export PS1="(chroot) $PS1"
	#Ask password for root
	#Ask name of user and password
	#Ask for Hostname. It will set hostname, dns
	#Do locale.gen
	
	#System Profile!

	###Ask for type of system####
	#GNOME, KDE, AWESOME, X, NONE#
	#This will setup anything necessary to setup those systems. Setp Packages, run commands
	###Services###
	#Distcc
	#Bash Complete
	#Grub
	#htpdate
	#Power Managment
	
	

#File 2: Execution
#Choose option
#Step 1: Pre chroot
	#Mount root parition to chroot directory
	#Mount boot parition to chroot/boot directoy
	#Find the architecture (i686, x86_64, PPC, PPC64)
	#Download Stage3
	#Make sure Stage3 matches the md5 sum
	#Unpack Stage3
	#Download Portage
	#Make sure Portage matches the md5 sum
	#Unpack Portage
	#Copy resolve.conf
	

#Step 2: Pre install
#Step 3: Install
#Step 4: Post install
#Step 5: Print post message
#Do all steps




# Tips for /etc/fstab
# Could this be done in parallel?
# Implement mirrorselect
# Print out what you need to know in the beginning
# Eix a list of kernel sources and ask what kernel they prefer.
# Should follow the Gentoo Guide steps

#Step 1 - Is date correct?
#Step 2 - Make directory for chroot
#Step 3 - Download Stage3 and Portage
#Step 4 - Move over resolv.conf
#Step 5 - Mount nessessary folder /proc /dev
#Step 6 - Message to setup Make.conf and display infomation important to do so
#Step 7 - Setup root password, User with groups, DNS hostname, hostname, System Profiler
#Step 8 - Ask for Grub2, Gnome/KDE/XFCE,Openbox, User Friendly packages (gentoolkit, app-shells/bash-completion, eix), ACPI
#Step 9 - Emerge... the long coffee break
#Step 10- Setup locale-gen, DHCP, Timezone, htpdate, rc-update necessary packages
#Step 11- Print out the next things they need to do, Kernel, Grub, and fstab. Also mention what needs to be done for maintenance

#Please run this as root. The gentoo handbook was designed to be in a root shell
