Gentoo Deployment Version 4
by Koodough Katsu

###Objective###
Answers all the questions needed to install Gentoo before any installation is perform and then walk way from the computer for about 3-4 hours form the computer and return with a fully operational Gentoo installation.


###Current Status###
Still buggy with with the "afp.sh" feature and some other ones as well.
Not so great handling with errors
Able to download, configure, and emerge packages for the most part 

###Yet TODO###
A small summary to TODO
Install Kernel
Install grub bootloader
Better Debugging the progress of the Gentoo installation
Better documentation to create features for Gentoo, and understand what the hell a feature is (or think of a better name to describe a complete package install like an app store for gentoo. Roll?)
Ability to isolate features to either test or execute
"install.sh" shouldn't copy the git repo to a target machine (not necessary to copy all those files)

###Introduction###

Gentoo Deployment was only made to ease the installation of Gentoo by following through the official guides on gentoo.org. Although the script doesn't follow the guides line by line, it does a good job at least downloading the Stage3 and Portage tarball.

###Usage###

Gentoo Deployment, runs best in a Gentoo environment, so either SystemrescueCD (testing OS) or a Gentoo Live CD will work fine on the target computer.

1. Target machine to install gentoo: git clone https://github.com/koodough/Gentoo-Deployment.git

or

1. Download Gentoo Deployment on any machine and then run 
./install.sh
This script will simply just copy the files to the target machine via ssh
Result: Gentoo Deployment folder should now by on your root folder on the target machine running some Gentoo environment operating system.

2. cd "/Gentoo Deployment"
3. Add or remove any features in the "features" folder. NOTE: Features can be very unstable, as many are still in the works
3. ./gentoo_deployment.sh
4. Follow through the steps from the ./gentoo_deployment.sh prompt 

###HELP!!!!###
If your new to Gentoo, DON'T use this script. Rather follow the official documentation gentoo.org, trust me.

If your encountering a bug, please email me at github@koodough.com or through the github website, user name is koodough.

If you have no idea what this script does but understand the principles of installing Gentoo, then probably this script isn't ready for prime time, yet.
