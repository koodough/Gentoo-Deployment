- Automatic Timezone
- Verify that automatic fstab works
- Create a script to make the computer profiles portable by git. Shouldn't be more than 2 command prompts when updating or receiving. Use git to resolve conflict merges

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

Soon
* Replace htpdate with ntpdate
* Guess what architecture the system is

* Fix Grub and the tab, if that messes up DOOM will happen. Will never boot correctly until its deleted in mtab. Maybe just delete mtab once 


Later
* DHCP or Manual option
* Test for internet before starting
* Ask if you plan on compiling your own kernel or using genkernel and emerge if necessary
* Better MD5 sum method to verify
* Support Graphics cards

Version 4
* Work on multiple architectures - x86, amd64, PPC, PPC64 using a skeleton commands for that arch
* Ncurses support
